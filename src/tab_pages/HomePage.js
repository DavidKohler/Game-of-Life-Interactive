              , serves as a place to experiment with life-like cellular automata
              -- drawing new automata (in the Draw tab), loading in existing
              automata (in the Load tab), or generating completely new and
              random automata (in the Random tab) -- and subsequently simulating
              generations of these automata to observe what happens. It is also
              worth noting that simulations on this site use a bounded grid
              rather than an infinite or boundless one (as other applications
              such as Golly might use), and thus boundaries and B0 rules may
              behave slightly differently

            <div>What are cellular automata?</div>
            <div>
              Cellular automata (plural for automaton), are a class of
              mathematical objects that have been used in the fields of
              microstructure modeling, physics, quantum mechanics, and
              theoretical biology. A cellular automaton consists of a grid of
              cells, each of which has a finite set of allowed states (such as
              on/off or alive/dead), and each of which also has a neighborhood
              of other cells that it interacts with. The state of the cellular
              automaton evolves over time, progressing through a number of
              generations. The state of each cell at time <i>t+1</i> depends on
              the state of each cell at time <i>t</i>, with a transition rule
              specified that determines how the state changes based on the
              states of each cell and neighborhood. <br />
              <br />A life-like cellular automaton is a subclass of cellular
              automata that has two dimensions, has two states (on/off or
              alive/dead), uses the Moore neighborhood, and has a semitotalistic
              rule. The most famous cellular automaton, and in fact what this
              subclass is named after, is Conway's Game of Life. This site
              focuses specifically on life-like cellular automata, of which
              there exist an incredible amount. For more info on cellular
              automata or on Conway's Game of Life, visit{' '}
